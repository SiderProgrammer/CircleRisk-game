# Circle Risk

Circle Risk android game source code (my best project right now but still bad for me)

Technology stack:
-mongodb (with mongoose)
-express.js
-phaser 3

Graphics were made by my brother.
Client is written in Phaser 3.
Database is handled with MongoDB, Mongoose.
Server is hosted on Heroku
The game has also AdMob intergration.

I learned a lot from developing this game.

Folders should have a different structure. Some files should have different names.
There is a lot of spaghetti code.
I see many other mistakes that could be corrected like : code repetition, bad functions names and so on.
Many features could be implemented easier, shorter, cleaner.
